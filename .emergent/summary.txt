The AI engineer successfully built an MVP for a modern property platform, Domy v Itálii, using Next.js, Sanity, and Supabase. Initial setup involved configuring environment variables and installing dependencies. A key challenge was Supabase database setup, which required a manual SQL script due to service role key limitations. The engineer focused on core features incrementally: property listings, then comprehensive navigation, followed by authentication. After fixing a Database error saving new user via a Supabase trigger update and fallback, user and admin dashboards were implemented. Spacing and layout issues in the admin panel were meticulously debugged and resolved, showcasing robust problem-solving. The work concluded with the user requesting email notifications.

The goal is to rebuild Domy v Itálii as a modern property platform for Italian real estate, targeting Czech and international buyers. The tech stack is Next.js (App Router, TypeScript, Tailwind, shadcn/ui), Sanity CMS for content, and Supabase for auth/user data with RLS. The MVP deliverables include a public website with homepage, search/listings, property detail, favorites, saved searches, inquiry forms, blog, and static pages. Admin features include Sanity Studio models for listings, regions, cities, amenities, developers, blog posts, and SEO, with i18n support. Supabase tables include , , , and , with specific RLS. SEO, sitemap, robots.txt, and clean URLs are required. Phase 2 features include comparison, virtual tours, investment guides, calculators, user roles, email alerts, and analytics. The current implementation covers the public website pages, authentication, admin panel, and user dashboard.

<current_work>
The immediate work concluded with the successful implementation and verification of the User Dashboard features (1-6) and the Admin Panel. The User Dashboard provides an overview, profile management, enhanced favorites, saved searches management, inquiry history, and property recommendations. All dashboard pages require authentication and feature responsive design, real-time Supabase data integration, and intuitive sidebar navigation. The Admin Panel includes user, inquiry, analytics, and content management, with role-based security. The AI engineer also meticulously fixed UI spacing and layout issues in the admin panel, specifically resolving the sidebar and main content stacking vertically instead of side-by-side. The application now has comprehensive public pages, authentication, and core dashboards.

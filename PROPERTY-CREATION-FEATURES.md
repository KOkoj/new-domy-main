- Meta descriptions can be auto-generated or manually specified

### Scheduled Publishing
- `publishAt` field stores ISO 8601 datetime string
- `scheduledPublish` boolean flag enables/disables scheduling
- Actual publishing automation requires a cron job or scheduled function (to be implemented)

### Validation
- Required fields: Title (EN), Property Type, Status, Price
- Optional but recommended: Images, Description, SEO fields
- System prevents saving without Sanity configuration

## Future Enhancements

Potential additions for future versions:
- Rich text editor (WYSIWYG) for descriptions

- Virtual tour integration
- Bulk image operations
- Image ordering/drag-to-reorder

## Environment Variables Required

```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_SANITY_PROJECT_ID=your-project-id

```

Without these, the system will show configuration warnings and prevent write operations.

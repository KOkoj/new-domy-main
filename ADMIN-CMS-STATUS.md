## 🔧 Configuration Required

To fully activate the CMS functionality, you need to set these environment variables:

```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_SANITY_PROJECT_ID=your_sanity_project_id
NEXT_PUBLIC_SANITY_DATASET=production
NEXT_PUBLIC_SANITY_API_VERSION=2023-05-03
SANITY_API_TOKEN=your_sanity_token  # For write operations
```

**Note:** The application will gracefully fall back to sample data if Sanity is not configured.

## 🎯 Next Steps (Optional Enhancements)

1. **Region Management CRUD**
   - Currently regions are read-only in admin
   - Could add create/edit/delete for regions

2. **Image Upload**
   - Currently property images need to be uploaded via Sanity Studio
   - Could add direct image upload in admin interface

3. **Bulk Operations**
   - Add bulk delete/edit for properties
   - Add bulk status updates

4. **Content Validation**
   - Add client-side validation before saving
   - Add server-side validation in API routes

5. **Preview Mode**
   - Add draft/preview functionality
   - Add scheduled publishing

## 🐛 Known Issues

None at this time. All core functionality is working correctly.

- All frontend pages gracefully handle missing Sanity configuration
- Sample data is used as fallback for demonstration purposes
- All CRUD operations require Sanity to be properly configured
- The content API returns appropriate error messages when Sanity is not configured
